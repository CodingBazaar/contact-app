# Contact Application

Welcome to the Contact Application repository! This project is a simple **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing contacts. It is built using **Spring Boot** and incorporates **Spring Security** for user authentication. The application utilizes an **H2 database** for storing contact information.

## Features

- User-friendly CRUD operations for managing contacts.
- Secure user authentication using Spring Security.
- Utilizes H2 database with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate.
- RESTful API endpoints for interaction.
- Postman collection for testing API endpoints.
- Screenshots showcasing Postman outcomes and H2 database tables.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-application.git
    ```
   
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (like *IntelliJ IDEA* or *Eclipse*).

3. Run the application. By default, the login page will be available at `http://localhost:8080/login`.

4. The default username is **"user"**, and the password will be autogenerated. You can find the autogenerated password in the Spring Console at startup. If you want to set the password manually, you can do so by adding it to the `application.properties` file.

## Database

The application uses the **H2 in-memory database** for data storage. You can access the H2 console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`. Use the following settings:

- **JDBC URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
- **Username**: `sa`
- **Password**: (Leave this field empty)

## API Endpoints

The project exposes the following **RESTful API endpoints**:

- `GET /api/getAllContacts` - Retrieve all contacts.
- `GET /api/getContactById/{id}` - Retrieve a contact by ID.
- `POST /api/addContact` - Add a new contact.
- `POST /api/updateContact/{id}` - Update an existing contact.
- `DELETE /api/deleteContactById/{id}` - Delete a contact by ID.
- `DELETE /api/deleteAllContacts` - Delete all contacts.

## Screenshots

Screenshots of **Postman** outcomes and **H2 database tables** are available in the `screenshots` directory of this repository.
